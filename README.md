# Assignment Backend Dev (Mid) @ Horizn Studios

Dear applicant,

We're excited that you want to join the Horizn Studios team!
We value and respect your time and that is why we want to thank you that you are on this page
and are going to start this challenge!

In this task, we do not expect from you the rocket science and/or anything special.
The main purpose is just to see how you think and what is your approach. At the end of the day,
we expect from you a basic well-structured app and clean, maintainable and scalable code.

## Challenge

Let's imagine the following scenario:

Due to Corona, the management of the company X decided to introduce the booking system for the desks and rooms in the office
in order to avoid the crowding and fast spreading of the infection. So each employee has to book a table before she/he/they come to the office. Additionally, meeting rooms can also be booked if needed. 

You as a backend developer have to deliver the basic logic for this app, which has the following **requirements**:

1. The desks/rooms could be booked between 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. from Mo till Fr (also on holidays).
2. The desks/rooms could be booked many times on one day (i.e. X booked it from 9-12 a.m., Y booked it from 3-5 p.m.)
3. An employee can book **one desk only** at the **certain time** 
(i.e. it is impossible for one person to book two tables between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the same day)
4. An employee can book **one meeting room only** at the **certain time**
(i.e. it is impossible for one person to book two rooms between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the same day)
5. However, one employee can book **one desk** as well as **one meeting room** at the same time of a day
(i.e. the same person is allowed to book one room and one desk between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the same day)

## Specifications
1. Please do not spend that much time! We do not expect a production ready app, but we would appreciate if you will list
some features in case it would be your main project and you would have a plenty of time.
2. You can use any **PHP/JS** framework and/or library.
3. You can deliver (i) frontend or (ii) do it as a console application or (iii) deliver an API interface or (iv) just program the basic logic and **add comments** to it.
All of these would be equally perfect!
4. Tests are important, please write them if you have extra time (if not just add a short comment).

## Your project
1. Please provide the link to GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repo.
2. Please add the DB dump file to the same repo.


We wish you good luck :rocket: and hope that you will have a bit of fun! :sunglasses:
